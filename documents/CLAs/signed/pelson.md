# SciTools Contributor License Agreement (v4)


Thank you for your interest in contributing to products managed by the Met Office on behalf
of SciTools.

In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person
or entity, SciTools projects must have a Contributor License Agreement ("**CLA**") on file that
has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below.
Each contributing individual within a contributing organisation must personally sign the CLA form.

This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of SciTools and
users of its products; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other
purpose.

Contributions shall be made by submitting a Pull Request to the relevant project code repository.

The Met Office will use and process your details collected for the purposes of contribution to
products owned or managed by the Met Office.
Your details will be processed in accordance with European Data Protection Law.
Personal data processed by the Met Office will not be disclosed to third parties for marketing
purposes.

Your signed CLA and GitHub profile name will be published on a public website.
This will permit Developers of a product to ascertain that you have signed this agreement.

Please open a Pull Request which removes the agreement to request that your GitHub name and signed
CLA be removed from the website if you no longer wish to contribute to SciTools products.
Please be aware that for purposes of recording previous agreements, it is not possible to withdraw
the signed CLA from the historical archive (git repository).

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future Contributions
submitted to SciTools projects.
In return, the Met Office shall not use Your Contributions in a way that is contrary to the
interests of users of the products.
Except for the license granted herein to the Met Office and recipients of software distributed
by SciTools, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.

To initiate the mediation a party to the Agreement must give notice in writing (the “ADR Notice”)

## 9. Mediation

The mediation is to take place not later than 30 Working Days after the ADR Notice.
If there is any issue on the conduct of the mediation upon which the Parties cannot agree within
14 Working Days of the ADR Notice, then EPANI shall, at the request of either party, decide the
issue for the Parties, having consulted with them.

Unless otherwise agreed, all negotiations connected with the dispute and any settlement shall
be conducted in confidence and without prejudice to the rights of the Parties in any future
proceedings.

to writing and shall be binding on the Parties once it is signed by both You and the Met Office.

or such longer period as may be agreed by the Parties, then any dispute or difference between them
